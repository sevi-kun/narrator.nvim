> Attention, This plugin is not usable as it is still under development

## Vision

This plugin is intended for users with no vision. It makes use of treesitter to generate context aware text, uses espeak-ng for text-to-speech and a ChatGPT integration for project, file or codeblock description is also planned.

## Development

Help is wanted, as this is my first neovim plugin.
