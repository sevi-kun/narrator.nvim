> Attention, This plugin is not usable as it is still under development

## Vision

This plugin is intended for users with no vision. It makes use of [treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) to generate context aware text, uses [speech-dispatcher](https://github.com/brailcom/speechd) for text-to-speech and some LLM integration for project, file or codeblock description is also planned.

## Development

Help is wanted, as this is my first neovim plugin.
