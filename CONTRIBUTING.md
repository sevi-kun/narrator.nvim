# Contributing

Contributions of all kinds are very welcome.

Please note that I only develop on linux for linux at the moment. However, improvements for windows or OSX are welcome as well.

## Getting started

For the plugin to work in any way you will need the following dependencies:

- speech-dispatcher

As I work with the spd-say command within the plugin, it's easy to verify if the setup works. Just try running a command like this: `spd-say 'Hello world'`
